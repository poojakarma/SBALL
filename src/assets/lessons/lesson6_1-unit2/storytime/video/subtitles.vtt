00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.554
<b>It was a bright moonlit night.</b>

2
00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:17.359
<b>All the animals in Mangu's
farm were sleeping.</b>

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.085
<b>Except Tinku!</b>

4
00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:26.046
<b>I am not sleepy, Ma,
murmured Tinku.</b>

5
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.343
<b>But Ma did not hear him.
She was fast asleep.</b>

6
00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:36.617
<b>He turned left, and
he turned right.</b>

7
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:40.140
<b>He rolled on his tummy, and
he rolled on his back.</b>

8
00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:42.257
<b>But he could not sleep!</b>

9
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.000
<b>So he set off into the night
to see what he could find.</b>

10
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.289
<b>Up in the sky, Tinku
saw the moon,</b>

11
00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:54.000
<b>white and round,
smiling down at him.</b>

12
00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:04.968
<b>He felt very happy. ‘Night is
beautiful,’ thought Tinku.</b>

13
00:01:05.374 --> 00:01:10.531
<b>Far away on top of a tree,
there were some tiny lights.</b>

14
00:01:14.187 --> 00:01:20.226
<b>One spot of light flew down! I’m a
firefly, said the spot of light.</b>

15
00:01:20.352 --> 00:01:22.179
<b>I glow in the dark!</b>

16
00:01:22.484 --> 00:01:25.812
<b>Will you be my friend? asked Tinku.</b>

17
00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:29.015
<b>Yes, I will! said the firefly.</b>

18
00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:33.468
<b>Something flew by and hung
upside down on a tree.</b>

19
00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:37.968
<b>What is your name, bird?
asked Tinku.</b>

20
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.703
<b>I am not a bird, I am a bat.</b>

21
00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.335
<b>I can see during the night!
said the bat.</b>

22
00:01:45.554 --> 00:01:48.164
<b>Will you be my friend?
asked Tinku.</b>

23
00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:50.757
<b>Yes, I will! said the bat.</b>

24
00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:57.484
<b>A few leaves moved in the bushes.
Someone was hiding!</b>

25
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.257
<b>Who are you? said Tinku.</b>

26
00:02:02.382 --> 00:02:05.843
<b>I am a fox, said the fox.</b>

27
00:02:05.984 --> 00:02:08.843
<b>I go strolling out at night.</b>

28
00:02:09.023 --> 00:02:11.968
<b>Will you be my friend?
asked Tinku.</b>

29
00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.828
<b>Yes, I will! said the fox.</b>

30
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:18.460
<b>Two shiny eyes looked
at him from a tree.</b>

31
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.421
<b>Who are you? asked Tinku.</b>

32
00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:28.812
<b>I’m an owl, said the owl. I
hunt for food during the night.</b>

33
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:32.187
<b>Will you be my friend?
asked Tinku.</b>

34
00:02:32.578 --> 00:02:35.351
<b>Yes, I will! said the owl.</b>

35
00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:40.046
<b>CHIRRRRRP! CHIRRRRRP! Who is here?
Tinku asked.</b>

36
00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:44.789
<b>I’m a cricket, said the cricket.
I chirp when it is dark.</b>

37
00:02:46.852 --> 00:02:49.570
<b>Will you be my friend?
asked Tinku.</b>

38
00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:52.242
<b>Yes, I will! said the cricket.</b>

39
00:02:52.554 --> 00:02:58.125
<b>Tinku and his friends jumped and
tossed and rolled until Tinku yawned.</b>

40
00:03:01.117 --> 00:03:05.757
<b>I am sleepy. I have to
go home now, said Tinku.</b>

41
00:03:06.023 --> 00:03:09.406
<b>He was happy that he
had made many new friends.</b>

42
00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:12.218
<b>Snuggling close to Ma, he said,</b>

43
00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:17.999
<b>Night is not a lonely place, Ma.
Night is full of wonderful beings.</b>

44
00:03:18.225 --> 00:03:25.750
<b>Yes! Said Ma. Your new friends are
nocturnal, just like wild dogs.</b>

45
00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:31.906
<b>Nocturnal animals eat,
play and work at night.</b>

46
00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:35.632
<b>They rest during the day.
You must sleep now.</b>

47
00:03:35.898 --> 00:03:40.640
<b>Sleep will give you energy to play
with your day-time friends tomorrow.</b>

48
00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.664
<b>Good night, little one! she
said, hugging him tight.</b>

49
00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.468
<b>The bright round moon
shone all night long,</b>

50
00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:51.679
<b>spreading her calm
light all around.</b>

51
00:03:53.304 --> 00:03:57.648
<b>And Tinku slept all
through the night!</b>
