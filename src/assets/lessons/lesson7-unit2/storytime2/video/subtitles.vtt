00:00:11.038 --> 00:00:15.937
<b>Samira made a face when she opened
her tiffin box and thought,</b>

2
00:00:16.257 --> 00:00:21.695
<b>Who wants to eat parathas
and brinjal curry? Not I.</b>

3
00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:27.390
<b>Last week Amma had given her
noodles with capsicum and carrots.</b>

4
00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:31.890
<b>The noodles are squiggly
and they look like worms,</b>

5
00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:34.773
<b>she said when she
went back home.</b>

6
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:37.148
<b>I don’t like noodles.</b>

7
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.890
<b>The next day, Amma made
upma with peanuts and peas,</b>

8
00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:51.718
<b>but Samira ate only the peanuts in
it and took the rest back home.</b>

9
00:00:51.976 --> 00:00:53.976
<b>It was like wet sand,</b>

10
00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:58.375
<b>she said when Amma asked her
why she hadn’t eaten it.</b>

11
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.687
<b>Shall I give you idlis? asked Amma.</b>

12
00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:08.093
<b>Oh, yes ! They would be lovely to
play with.I can toss and catch them.</b>

13
00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:13.078
<b>But I will not eat
them—idlis taste like mud.</b>

14
00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:21.007
<b>So now there were parathas and
brinjal curry. Ugh, ugh, ugh!</b>

15
00:01:21.476 --> 00:01:28.031
<b>Shutting her tiffin box with a bang,
Samira went to the school courtyard.</b>

16
00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:34.031
<b>A row of ants crawling
along the wall said,</b>

17
00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.312
<b>Samira, why aren’t you eating your
lunch like all the other children?</b>

18
00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:41.882
<b>Samira said,</b>

19
00:01:42.257 --> 00:01:48.703
<b>I don’t like parathas. I don’t like
vegetables. I don’t want any lunch.</b>

20
00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:52.703
<b>Of course, one cannot
eat vegetables,</b>

21
00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:54.101
<b>the ants agreed.</b>

22
00:01:55.054 --> 00:01:59.640
<b>They offered her the wing of a cockroach
that they were carefully carrying and said,</b>

23
00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:05.953
<b>Now try this, it is
really delicious.</b>

24
00:02:08.547 --> 00:02:12.734
<b>Oh no! I don’t want any
horrible cockroaches,</b>

25
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:16.218
<b>said Samira and ran
away to the garden.</b>

26
00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:22.625
<b>Colourful flowers were
blooming in the garden</b>

27
00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:26.320
<b>and butterflies were flitting
from one to the other.</b>

28
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:32.453
<b>An orange butterfly with black
checks and stripes said,</b>

29
00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:37.460
<b>Hello Samira! Why aren’t you eating
your lunch like all the other children?</b>

30
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.156
<b>Samira said, I don’t like parathas. I don’t
like vegetables. I don’t want any lunch.</b>

31
00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:50.304
<b>Of course, one cannot eat
vegetables, the butterfly agreed.</b>

32
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.109
<b>Why don’t you drink some nectar from the
flowers like us? It is really delicious.</b>

33
00:02:56.391 --> 00:03:01.750
<b>Samira put her tongue into the centre
of a flower but could find nothing!</b>

34
00:03:02.422 --> 00:03:08.179
<b>I don’t want any nectar. And I think
you are fooling me, she cried.</b>

35
00:03:08.703 --> 00:03:11.351
<b>She ran to the big pipal
tree in the lawn.</b>

36
00:03:13.734 --> 00:03:16.116
<b>A crow cawing above called,</b>

37
00:03:17.514 --> 00:03:22.726
<b>Hello Samira! Why aren’t you eating
your lunch like all the other children?</b>

38
00:03:23.062 --> 00:03:30.968
<b>Samira said, I don’t like parathas. I don’t
like vegetables. I don’t want any lunch.</b>

39
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.081
<b>Of course, one cannot eat
vegetables, the crow agreed,</b>

40
00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:38.721
<b>Here, I’ll give you
something nice,</b>

41
00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:42.334
<b>and it dropped a halfeaten
mouse for Samira.</b>

42
00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:49.809
<b>Oh no! What a terrible thing! Keep your
mouse for yourself, screamed Samira</b>

43
00:03:51.374 --> 00:03:53.874
<b>and ran away to stand
near the wall.</b>

44
00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:04.225
<b>Some sparrows were chirruping on the
ledge of the wall and called out,</b>

45
00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:09.024
<b>Hello Samira! Why aren’t you eating
your lunch like all the other children?</b>

46
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:16.635
<b>Samira said, I don’t like parathas. I don’t
like vegetables. I don’t want any lunch.</b>

47
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.796
<b>Of course, one cannot eat
vegetables, the sparrows agreed.</b>

48
00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:27.368
<b>Here are some crunchy grains of
barley — they are really nutritious.</b>

49
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.303
<b>Samira chewed one
and made a face.</b>

50
00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:34.390
<b>This is like eating pebbles.
Even upma is better.</b>

51
00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:37.297
<b>A kind sparrow at
once asked her,</b>

52
00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.015
<b>Would you like some soft, juicy
worms instead? Just a minute…</b>

53
00:04:42.273 --> 00:04:46.417
<b>Just before it flew off to
get her a worm, Samira said,</b>

54
00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:51.654
<b>Worms indeed. No, thank you! I
would much rather eat noodles,</b>

55
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.002
<b>and ran to the gate
of the school.</b>

56
00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.162
<b>A cow was lazily chewing
cud just outside</b>

57
00:05:02.765 --> 00:05:04.720
<b>and mooed when it saw Samira.</b>

58
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:11.681
<b>Hello! it called, Why aren’t you eating
your lunch like all the other children?</b>

59
00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.117
<b>Samira said,</b>

60
00:05:13.457 --> 00:05:19.709
<b>I don’t like parathas. I don’t like
vegetables, I don’t want any lunch.</b>

61
00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:26.385
<b>Of course, cooked brinjal aren’t
nice at all, the cow agreed.</b>

62
00:05:26.707 --> 00:05:30.187
<b>Let me bite off some
of this grass for you</b>

63
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.920
<b>it is particularly
sweet after the rains.</b>

64
00:05:34.172 --> 00:05:37.475
<b>You should eat it with the
hibiscus bush next to you.</b>

65
00:05:37.715 --> 00:05:42.483
<b>You are so lucky. I wish I
could get inside this gate.</b>

66
00:05:42.736 --> 00:05:44.698
<b>Samira was disgusted.</b>

67
00:05:44.914 --> 00:05:49.415
<b>She said, I don’t want to eat any grass.
Nor any bushes.</b>

68
00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:54.653
<b>Even idlis would taste better than grass.
And I am glad the gate is closed</b>

69
00:05:55.401 --> 00:06:00.058
<b>because the hibiscus has pretty flowers
and I don’t want you to eat them.</b>

70
00:06:00.213 --> 00:06:05.196
<b>Samira ran back to her classroom
and opened her lunch box.</b>

71
00:06:05.376 --> 00:06:10.841
<b>How nice my parathas and brinjal curry
are, she thought and quickly ate them up.</b>
