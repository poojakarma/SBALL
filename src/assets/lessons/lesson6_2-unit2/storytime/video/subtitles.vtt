<b>Once upon a time there was
a poor woman and her son.</b>

2
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.703
<b>The poor woman asked her son,</b>

3
00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:21.351
<b>What can I get for you from
the market, little one?</b>

4
00:00:21.492 --> 00:00:26.484
<b>Now the boy was fascinated with
the sound of a drum. So he said:</b>

5
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:31.570
<b>A drum, mother, I would love
to have a drum to play with.</b>

6
00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.242
<b>The mother was poor</b>

7
00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:38.704
<b>so when she saw a nice piece of wood
on the road, she brought it home.</b>

8
00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:42.304
<b>The son happily
carried it and sang:</b>

9

<b>I asked for a drum and look at what
I got, A lovely piece of a wood!</b>

10

met an old man who could not start a fire.</b>

12
00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:07.960
<b>The boy gave the
old man his wood</b>

13
00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:13.601
<b>and the old man made some bread
and gave a piece to the boy.</b>

14
00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:15.710
<b>The boy sang away,</b>

15

<b>My piece of wood got me some food.
A lovely piece of bread.</b>

16
00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:30.030

<b>The kind-hearted boy gave the lady his bread
and the lady gave a large pot to the boy.</b>

20
00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:56.802
<b>The boy sang away, I gave my
bread away and look what I got!</b>

21
00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:01.989
<b>I gave my bread away and
I got a lovely pot</b>

22
00:02:02.293 --> 00:02:05.579

<b>As I walked along,
with a pot in hand,</b>

28

<b>I met a washerman. Who gave
me this coat so grand!</b>

29

<b>As he went skipping along, coat in hand,
he met a man shivering in the cold.</b>

32
00:02:55.083 --> 00:02:59.825
<b>He was robbed and had nothing
but a big fine horse.</b>

33

38
00:03:34.512 --> 00:03:41.106
<b>As he went skipping along, horse

39
00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:47.349
<b>The groom said, I am the groom.
Waiting to see my bride,</b>

40
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.169
<b>But I’m stuck in here
Just hoping for a ride!</b>

41
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.364
<b>I just can’t go there on my feet. My
horse is late and so is the hour.</b>

42

<b>what he could give in
exchange for his horse.</b>

46

<b>The boy looked around among the musicians
and quickly spotted the drummer.</b>

47
00:04:21.715 --> 00:04:26.660
<b>He said: A stitch in time
they say saves nine.</b>

48
00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:33.325
<b>And what indeed did save the day,

49
00:04:33.552 --> 00:04:38.599
<b>All I want from you is the fine

<b>The boy went home
singing a merry tune,</b>

53

<b>The coat did help a needy man.</b>

57
00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:23.442
<b>It got me a big fine horse to ride.</b>

58
00:05:23.738 --> 00:05:28.888
<b>With that horse, I got
a groom his bride!</b>

59
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.153
